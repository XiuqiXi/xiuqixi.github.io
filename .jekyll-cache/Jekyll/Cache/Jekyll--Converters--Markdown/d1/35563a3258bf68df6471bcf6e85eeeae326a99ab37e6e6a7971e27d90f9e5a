<h2 id="trade-specialization-and-division-of-labor">Trade, Specialization, and Division of Labor</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Specialization occurs when people and countries concentrate their efforts on a particular set of tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It permits each person and country to use to best advantage the specific skills and resources that are available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By contrast, countries which have tried the strategy of becoming selfâ€“sufficient-attempting to produce most of what they consumeâ€“have discovered that this is the road to stagnation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Trade can enrich all nations and increase everyoneâ€™s living standards.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Specialization and trade are the key to high living standards. By specialization, people can become highly productive in a very narrow field of expertise. People can then trade their specialized goods for othersâ€™ products, vastly increasing the range and quality of consumption and having the potential to raise everyoneâ€™s living standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The major causes of financial-market integration have been the dismantling of restrictions on capital flows among nations, cost reductions, and innovations in financial markets, particularly the use of new kinds of financial instruments.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="side-effects">Side Effects</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>One consequence of economic integration is the unemployment and lost profits that occur when low-cost foreign producers displace domestic production.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A second consequence comes when financial integration triggers international financial crises.</p>
