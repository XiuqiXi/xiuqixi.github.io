## Cold Plasma in Moving Flow

Consider a cold plasma made up of electrons and ions with mass $M_{i}$ and electrical charge $Z$. The ions have an equilibrium flow speed $
\mathbf{u}_{o i}$ and the electrons flow so that there in no equilibrium plasma current. There is no equilibrium magnetic field

The equilibrium flows are such that there is no net current. We demand that the plasma is quasi-neutral. This provides a unique relationship between the equilibrium electron and ion density.

$$
0=\operatorname{Zen}_{z 0}-e n_{e 0}
$$

$$
n_{z 0}=\frac{n_{e 0}}{Z}
$$

The no current constraints yields the relationship.

$$
0=n_{z 0} Z e \mathbf{u}_{z 0}-n_{e 0} e \mathbf{u}_{c 0}
$$

Using the above relationship for nz0, we see that the electrons and ion fluids flow with the same speed.

$$
\mathbf{u}_{e 0}=\mathbf{u}_{z 0}
$$
